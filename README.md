**benchmarking-tool_CAFE** is a Python library aimed at providing a benchmarking to estimate the predictive skill of ENSO-related extremes. 

It provides tools necessary to perform a wide range of tasks, such as:

* benchmarking predictive skill of deterministic forecasts of binary events (e.g. climate network-based ENSO forecast)
* visualization of a quantitative forecast validation
* providing composite analysis for weather anomalies (e.g. temperature anoamlies or precipitation anomalies) related to climate variabilities such as ENSO, AAO and etc.
* performing univariate Extreme Value Analysis ([EVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory)) for ENSO-related weather extremes based on the python package [pyextremes](https://georgebv.github.io/pyextremes/)


## Installation

latest version of this python library will be available in March
