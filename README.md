# benchmarking
These are the main codings for the reproduction for the work Benchmarking prediction skill in binary El Niño forecasts, which is published on Climate Dynamicss (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-021-05950-2).

## About
**Documentation:** https://github.com/xiaohouzi-412/benchmarking/tree/master

**Support:** ask a question or create an issue, any input is appreciated and would help develop the project

**Coding** aimed at providing a benchmarking to estimate the predictive skill of binary forecast like climate network-based El Niño forecasts.

It provides tools necessary to perform a wide range of tasks, such as:

* reproducing establishment of climate network and apply this to El Niño prediction.
* benchmarking predictive skill of deterministic forecasts of binary events (e.g. climate network-based ENSO forecast)
* visualization of a quantitative forecast validation

## Instructions
In the paper, we reproduced two climate network-based El Niño prediction models based on the work by Ludescher (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1323058111) and Meng (10.1088/1367-2630/aabb25). We established a benchmarking method by surrogate data for a quantitative forecast validation for small data sets. 

* Reproduce_Ludescher.py provides the reproducement of Ludescher's paper
* Reproduce_Meng.py provides the reproducement of Meng's paper
* shifting.py contains the benchmarking tool for these binary predictions
